    Hello! I am Tejasree (Teja) Seelam, a senior Computer Science student and aspiring Software Engineer and Business
    Analyst.

    Before starting college at NJIT, I had no experience in coding. I understood the demand of the technology industry
    and decided to pursue a Computer Science degree.
    However, after going through my courses, working on numerous projects and participating in internships, I have
    gained a passion for this field.

    As an experienced Computer Science student, I aim to work with tools and technologies that will provide benefit to
    my employer and advance my passion for this field.
