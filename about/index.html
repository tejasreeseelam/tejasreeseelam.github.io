    Before starting college at NJIT, I had no experience in coding. I understood the demand of the technology industry
    and decided to pursue a Computer Science degree. However, after going through my courses, working on numerous
    projects and participating in internships, I have gained a passion for this field.

    my employer and advance my passion for this field.
